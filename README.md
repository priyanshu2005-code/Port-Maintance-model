# Port-Maintance-model
🚢 Predictive Maintenance Model for Port Equipment

📌 Overview

This project implements a predictive maintenance system for port equipment using Machine Learning. The model analyzes various operational parameters and predicts whether maintenance is required, helping to reduce downtime, optimize scheduling, and enhance efficiency in port operations.

🔍 Objective

Predict potential equipment failures using machine learning.
Improve maintenance planning to reduce costs and prevent unexpected failures.
Utilize real-time and historical data for accurate decision-making.
🏗 Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries Used:
pandas, numpy - Data manipulation
scikit-learn - Machine learning model
matplotlib, seaborn - Data visualization
datetime - Time-based feature engineering
📊 Dataset

The dataset is synthetically generated using domain-specific parameters, including:

Power Consumption (in kW)
Temperature & Humidity
Equipment Age (in days)
Operational Hours
Load Capacity (%)
Voltage Variation & Power Factor
Vibration Level
Number of Ships Berthed
Timestamp Features (Hour, Day, Month)
The target variable (maintenance_needed) is determined based on a combination of:

High power consumption with older equipment
Poor power factor
High vibration levels under heavy load
Extreme voltage variations
Operational stress (long hours + high load capacity)
